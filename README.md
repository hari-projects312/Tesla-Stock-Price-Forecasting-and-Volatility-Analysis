This project predicts the risk of football injuries for university players using machine learning. Player performance, physical tests, and training data are analyzed to train three models â€” Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The models are compared based on accuracy, with results visualized through confusion matrices and feature importance. A Streamlit app is deployed to allow users to input player details, view predictions, and check the accuracy of each model.
